Include bonito/bonita cases. To show that with multiple subjects it's the immediately dominating one.

Include cases where the antecedent is something other than a subject.

Background on the lit on how memory is encoded and navigated. Point to Sturt BV paper and Kazanina et al Condition C paper.
Lift stuff from grant proposal in ref. to the debate.

Mention that logic of the study is similar to Sturt and Xiang & Dillon et al, and agreement studies.
	Reflexives: interferer makes no difference. With NPIs and agreement, they do.

Describe construction of an item set in detail:
	e.g. We include an intermediate clause with a singular impersonal subject, to avoid confounds of clause-to-clause agreement matching.
	
Describe conditions
	adding in number factor on the matrix verb (fossem/fosse)
	Why do the singular?
		Drawbacks:
			double item set
			not sure whether it licenses an impersonal reading
	
		Plural:
			downstream agreement: bug or feature? could go either way. mention this.
			
Details about the number of items etc.
Estimate of how long each session should take
How many subjects we'll need


Need to establish: 

1. that BP is sensitive to number morphology.
2. that Holmberg generalizations hold. 

General questions.

* recruiting
* logisitcs about running studies (space etc)
* Timing?

in re number marking in BP. 

Q: Is there reason to worry that people who don't use number marking consistently might fail to notice it when people DO use it.
